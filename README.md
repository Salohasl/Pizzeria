# Pizzeria
 Not much of the project

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">about the project :
- The website of the pizzeria, with a basket and payment via a telegram bot or through an online cash register, is not yet clear
- There is a form in the feedback folder, but it has not been completed yet, and the code is also not optimized at this stage
- The deadline is given in 2 weeks

 ---

 :man_technologist:The project is at the first stage, it is expected that the CMS will be WordPress

 ---

 :fire:Fact
 - This is a pizzeria franchise website
 - the original site was made by a whole team, but Iâ€™ll do this one alone
